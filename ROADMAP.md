# Plan for 0.4.0

Introduce the repo-client, as a porting from the corresponding module in LionWeb Kotlin.
This will serve as the basis to introduce the support to the delta protocol.
Support for the delta protocol will be tested against the LionWeb Repository, therefore
we need to wait for the protocol to be supported in that project, before proceeding with
the development.
