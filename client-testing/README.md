# Repo-client-testing

Building functional tests relying on the LionWeb Repo Client is difficult as 
it requires running a Postgres DB and the LW Repository. To make it easier
we created this module, which is also used when testing the `repo-client` module
in this same project. We expect it will be useful to others building applications
based on the `repo-client` module.
