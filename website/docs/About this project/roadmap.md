# Status and Roadmap

The project currently support the core specifications.

We will work on implementing support for the delta protocol, as soon as it will be implemented in the LionWeb Repository.

We will then proceed to review the project, performing some general maintenance and release version 1.0.

Despite the version number being below 1.0, the project is mature, well tested, and used in production.
