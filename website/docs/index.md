# Welcome to LionWeb Java

LionWeb Java is a Java implementation of the LionWeb specification, providing libraries for working with languages and models in the LionWeb ecosystem.

If you are using Kotlin, you may want to look at [LionWeb Kotlin](https://github.com/LionWeb-io/lionweb-kotlin), which builds upon this library.

## What is LionWeb?

LionWeb is a specification for model-based software engineering that provides:
- A common format for exchanging models
- Protocols for making components interoperable
- Tools for working with models, most notably repositories
- Integration with existing modeling tools

## Features

- Support for the definition nodes and languages
- Serialization and deserialization in JSON, Protobuf, and Flatbuffers
- Client-side implementation of the LionWeb bulk protocol, with support for delta coming soon
- Bidirectional conversion between LionWeb and EMF
- Support for both 2023.1 and 2024.1 specifications
