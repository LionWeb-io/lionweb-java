# Changelog

### 1.4.3

* Add explicit messages to all bare `Objects.requireNonNull` calls across the codebase; use lambda suppliers where the message involves string concatenation to avoid unnecessary allocation
* Centralise Gradle build configuration: introduce `lionweb-java-conventions`, `lionweb-kotlin-conventions`, `lionweb-functional-test-conventions` convention plugins in `buildSrc` covering JVM source/target compatibility, toolchain, `mavenCentral()` repository, JUnit Platform test runner, test logging, `sourcesJar`, and the `functionalTest` suite skeleton; remove the resulting duplication from all submodule build files
* Bump Kotlin to 2.4.0

### Version 1.4.2

* Reorganize server package structure; introduce `HTTPBulkServer` with full RESTful bulk and inspection API endpoints
* Add integration tests for `HTTPBulkServer` bulk and inspection APIs
* Rename `LionWebClient` to `LionWebBulkClient`; remove deprecated classes and interfaces
* Remove unused `AdditionalInfoData` class
* Add `@NotNull`/`@Nullable` annotations across client APIs (`BulkRequestFailureException`, `DeltaClient`, and others) for improved null safety
* Refactor `DeltaClient` with stricter participation checks
* Bump dependencies: Kotlin 2.3.21, kotest 6.1.11, javapoet 0.16.0, OkHttp 5.3.2
* Add class-level Javadoc to all public classes and interfaces across `core`, `client`, `client-testing`, `emf`, `extensions`, and `gradle-plugin` modules
* Add `@see` links to the [LionWeb Delta API specification](https://lionweb.io/specification/delta/delta-api.html) on all delta protocol message classes
* Revised nullability annotations in the entire codebase
* Modernize Java 9+ collection factory methods: replace `Collections.emptyList/singletonList/emptyMap/emptySet` and `Arrays.asList` (for constant data) with `List.of`, `Map.of`, and `Set.of` across production sources
* Remove deprecated `lowLevelRepoClient` from `LionWebClient` (Kotlin); migrate `isNodeExisting`, `getParentId`, and `nodesByClassifier` to use `jRepoClient` directly; delete now-unused `LowLevelRepoClient`, and Kotlin-specific `ClassifierKey`/`ClassifierResult` duplicates in favour of the canonical `io.lionweb.client.api` types

### Version 1.4.1

* Align all delta messages to match the integration test expectations
* Merged CommonChecks in IdUtils
* Add support for common delta commands in DeltaClient
* Add demo utilities to validate the behavior of the delta server

### Version 1.4.0

**Breaking change:** JDK 8 support is dropped. The minimum supported runtime is now Java 11.
Tested and supported Java versions: 11, 17, 21, and 25.

* Drop JDK 8 support; minimum runtime is now Java 11; add Java 25 to the CI matrix
* Bump dependencies: protobuf 4.35.0, Guava 33.6.0-jre, Jetbrains annotations 26.1.0, testcontainers 1.21.4, emfjson 2.3.0, javapoet 0.15.0, protobuf Gradle plugin 0.10.0, vanniktech publish plugin 0.36.0
* Explicitly declare `jsr305` as `compileOnly`/`testCompileOnly` across all modules (fixes compilation after Guava removed its transitive JSR-305 dependency)
* Remove all generated protobuf message classes (`PBChunk`, `PBNode`, `PBBulkImport`, etc.) — `ProtoBufSerialization` now delegates entirely to `DirectProtoBufSerializer` / `DirectProtoBufDeserializer`; proto files and the protobuf codegen Gradle plugin are removed from `core` and `extensions`
* Add `DirectBulkImportSerializer` for bulk-import protobuf serialization without generated classes; `ExtraProtoBufSerialization.serializeBulkImportToBytes` now uses it
* Improve `DirectProtoBufDeserializer` to throw `DeserializationException` when a metapointer references an out-of-bounds language index
* Remove deprecated `ReferenceValue.setReferred()`/`setResolveInfo()` mutators (use `withReferred()`/`withResolveInfo()` builder methods instead) and `AbstractSerialization.DEFAULT_SERIALIZATION_FORMAT` constant

## lionweb-java-2023.1-* - Version 0.2.0

This is the first release based on the new artifact ids (which now include the specifications version), which indicate support for the specification of LionWeb released under version 2023.1.

At this stage support for the M1 and M2 APIs is relatively complete. Support for annotations may need refinements. Some constraints may not yet been verified.
Import and export from and to EMF is a work in progress.
