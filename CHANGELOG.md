## lionweb-java-2023.1-* - Version 0.2.0

This is the first release based on the new artifact ids (which now include the specifications version), which indicate support for the specification of LionWeb released under version 2023.1.

At this stage support for the M1 and M2 APIs is relatively complete. Support for annotations may need refinements. Some constraints may not yet been verified.
Import and export from and to EMF is a work in progress.
